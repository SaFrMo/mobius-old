# Mobius
Race your opponent to build a ship to take you off the prison planet Mobius! LD38 jam entry.

## Notes
In Mobius, the player faces off against an AI opponent. You can win by building a shuttle to take you off the planet, or by surviving when your opponent dies.

Players can spend their time building a ship, trying to kill their opponent, or trying to steal their opponent's ship.

Actors can switch between Health Regeneration and Health Stasis at will. The lower an actor's health, the faster they can move. Actors can use this for a speed boost, although doing so puts their survival at risk. There is a slight delay between being hurt and regenerating health, as well as toggling into Health Regeneration mode and the actual health regeneration.

Players will need to acquire materials and use them in simple Minecraft-style recipes to build shuttle components, weapons, armor, and defenses.
