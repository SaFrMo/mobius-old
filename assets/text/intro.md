Ladies and gentlemen...

The Company and its media subsidiaries is proud to present everyone's favorite summertime game show...

Planet Mobius!

We all know how hard it is to stay focused in your cramped quarters, especially as our trip to Alpha Centauri nears the long-awaited halfway point.

But we need your minds sharp and your reports flawless!

Your work is the basis for the Company's continued profits back home, as well as the secure storage of your families in long-term cryogenic facilities.

We'd hate to have to make any cuts to those state-of-the-art operations, so keep that data flowing!

When you run into trouble and don't pick up the slack, the Company is happy to help you reorient yourself, as well as provide some welcome entertainment for the rest of the passengers.

That's why the lowest-performing workers each year get a chance to stretch their legs on Planet Mobius!

Planet Mobius is an arena specially built to take advantage of manipulated gravity. Keep running and you'll wind up where you once thought was upside-down - and eventually back where you started!

The Contestant faces off against a randomly-selected Company AI product in an attempt to build their way out of the arena.

The Contestant and AI both blast failed Company prototypes to obtain supplies, then build the Gateway with those supplies. First one through a Gateway wins!

But will either or both focus on building weapons and traps instead of a Gateway to take the other out?

If a Contestant or AI dies on Mobius, the other wins...

...but be warned, blasting your way to victory is tougher than it looks against our deadly AIs!

No matter how you go about it, only one sentient will leave the arena alive - can you earn your keep against the Company AIs, or will you join the ranks of the lesser scientists who have gone before?

The choice is yours on PLANET MOBIUS!
